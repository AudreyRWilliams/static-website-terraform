# Deploy A Static Website Using Terraform
This project will create an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.  The site files will be uploaded via Terraform.
## Static Website using Terraform - I deployed a static website to AWS using Terraform. I used AWS, S3 bucket to host the site, and an IAM policy to make the site public.  I installed Terraform in a GitHub Codespace as well as wrote the ‘tf’ programs there.  The environment was set up with my AWS credentials before deploying the Terraform application.
